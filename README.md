Hello, welcome to my portfolio page!

For this assignment, I created a portfolio page of my current work, that will also serve as the page I continue to add work to as the course continues. The basis of the site was built around using correct CSS selectors as well as flex-box and creating responsive layouts.

This assignment helped give me a strong grasp of how flex-box works as well as how to properly use the box model. It also shows how important using the debugging tools is to see how the site responds to smaller screens. Given a majority of people new browse the web through a phone, it is important to ensure your websites are properly adjusting to smaller screens.

Much like the first assignment, reaching a "client's" wishes were involved. This included linking navigation links to each section of the portfolio, and adhering to dimensions of each section as requested. The sections also are properly linked to the applications of the portfolio, and will launch will clicked. The portfolio also includes a small bio and avatar as requrested.

The greatest challenge of this assignment was definitely grasping flex-box and applying the box model for proper margins and spacing. It was a huge help having a hands on experience for future application in future projects.
